JSDownloader
============

JSDownloader provides a simple way to download various JavaScript libraries into your project. It does this by providing direct
links to various JavaScript libraries and a quick link to download.

Currently JSDownloader supports a limited set of libraries. It sources its data from a file called jsdownloader_index.json. 

ToDo: Write the docs for the jsdownloader_index.json file.
